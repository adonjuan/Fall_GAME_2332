Game Brainstorming

## Scene

I wanted the feel of the game to be a warm comfortable feel, on a foriegn planet with no knowledge of the land.
For the time perkoid I would think itd be based more in the future where people had the knowledge to create a craft that could withstand outer space
but not be as bulky as a regular spaceship.

## Setting

This planet would contain red tones like mars, but would have lots of vegetation. The vegetation would be different than your regular trees and plants
on Earth. But this planet is just somewhere random in spcae, but there are other visible planets in the sky. Potential creatures/enemies could be present
but would be more of just a scare factor rather than harmful.

## Character

A lone explorer or advunture that travels a lot to try and find new places and resources. However, when venturing to this planet his space craft
crashed or somehow broke and he needs to repair it to be safe or go home. With strange sounds and unknown lands, his main goal it to ger his ship
up and running again.

## Character Progression

Describe how the character progresses through the scene, setting, and personal development.
After discovering the ship needs repair, the explorer must venture through the vegetation to try to find reources or scatter parts to bring back to
his ship to begin the repairing process. Through their travels the explorer becomes more familiar with the land and it's resources to the point where
progressing to find each piece becomes easier to do so.
